## Expiring Partitions

You can set `partition.expiration-time` when creating a partitioned table. Table Store will periodically check
the status of partitions and delete expired partitions according to time.

How to determine whether a partition has expired: compare the time extracted from the partition with the current
time to see if survival time has exceeded the `partition.expiration-time`.

An example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE T (...) PARTITIONED BY (dt) WITH (
    'partition.expiration-time' = '7 d',
    'partition.expiration-check-interval' = '1 d',
    'partition.timestamp-formatter' = 'yyyyMMdd'
);
```

More options:

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 20%">Option</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 5%">Default</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 10%">Type</th>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 60%">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>

            <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">1 h</td>

            <td>The check interval of partition expiration.</td>

            <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">(none)</td>
            <td>Duration</td>
            <td>The expiration interval of a partition. A partition will be expired if itâ€˜s lifetime is over this value. Partition time is extracted from the partition value.</td>
